# INSIGHTS 

## Introduction: 
<p align="justify"> In the evolving landscape of technology and innovation, our team was assigned five projects that spanned various domains. The first project was "Slash", a web application meticulously crafted to scrape data from the most popular e-commerce websites, offering users a seamless experience in their quest for the best deals on a wide range of products. Our second project, "Cheap Buy," emerged as a sibling to Slash. While both projects revolve around finding the best deals for products, Cheap Buy takes a unique approach by accepting hyperlinks of products as input. The third project "Auto Anki", is a tool that bridges the gap between learning and memorization. Auto Anki is designed to transform comprehensive lectures into flashcards. Our fourth project “Stock Guide and Analyst” is focused on analyzing and predicting stocks. By leveraging complex algorithms and utilizing relevant data, they showcased a tool capable of forecasting stock market trends. Our fifth project centers around health and fitness. The "Calorie App" is a platform that not only helps users track their workouts but also offers a range of courses and resources related to fitness and well-being.  </p>

## Difficulties Faced:  

<p align="justify">The first issue which we faced was that we were tasked with rubric to evaluate five assigned projects. We encountered assessment related challenges when completing these evaluations. We had problems with inaccessible badges like build badges and the absence of status badges from automated tools like Pylint and Pycco. Despite the existence of workflow files in GitHub, there are issues with their execution and have no results. These problems made the process of grading the project problematic, as the presence of badges without associated status values may be attributed to a variety of variables, including GitHub permissions, as well as potential Pylint setup issues. As a result, we found it difficult to develop fair and reliable grading criteria under these conditions.  </p>

<p align="justify">While we tried to execute the projects, the builds were unsuccessful as the dependencies’ versions have been deprecated. There was also no support for troubleshooting available in documentation, which makes it difficult for the users and developers to troubleshoot if they face an error while building. At the beginning, it was quite challenging to identify the issue lying within the code. It took us a significant amount of time to discover that the problem was related to the versions of the dependencies. Meticulously verifying each version and updating the dependency requirements file was the hardest part.  </p>

<p align="justify">Besides, there are no pre-built binaries or executables available in releases, the projects are required to be built by the user. This might be very challenging for regular users, who could lose interest in the project due to the process of building.</p>
