# INSIGHTS 

## Introduction: 
<p align="justify"> In the evolving landscape of technology and innovation, our team was assigned five projects that spanned various domains. The first project was "Slash", a web application meticulously crafted to scrape data from the most popular e-commerce websites, offering users a seamless experience in their quest for the best deals on a wide range of products. Our second project, "Cheap Buy," emerged as a sibling to Slash. While both projects revolve around finding the best deals for products, Cheap Buy takes a unique approach by accepting hyperlinks of products as input. The third project "Auto Anki", is a tool that bridges the gap between learning and memorization. Auto Anki is designed to transform comprehensive lectures into flashcards. Our fourth project “Stock Guide and Analyst” is focused on analyzing and predicting stocks. By leveraging complex algorithms and utilizing relevant data, they showcased a tool capable of forecasting stock market trends. Our fifth project centers around health and fitness. The "Calorie App" is a platform that not only helps users track their workouts but also offers a range of courses and resources related to fitness and well-being.  </p>

## Difficulties Faced:  

<p align="justify">The first issue which we faced was that we were tasked with rubric to evaluate five assigned projects. We encountered assessment related challenges when completing these evaluations. We had problems with inaccessible badges like build badges and the absence of status badges from automated tools like Pylint and Pycco. Despite the existence of workflow files in GitHub, there are issues with their execution and have no results. These problems made the process of grading the project problematic, as the presence of badges without associated status values may be attributed to a variety of variables, including GitHub permissions, as well as potential Pylint setup issues. As a result, we found it difficult to develop fair and reliable grading criteria under these conditions.  </p>

<p align="justify">While we tried to execute the projects, the builds were unsuccessful as the dependencies’ versions have been deprecated. There was also no support for troubleshooting available in documentation, which makes it difficult for the users and developers to troubleshoot if they face an error while building. At the beginning, it was quite challenging to identify the issue lying within the code. It took us a significant amount of time to discover that the problem was related to the versions of the dependencies. Meticulously verifying each version and updating the dependency requirements file was the hardest part.  </p>

<p align="justify">Besides, there are no pre-built binaries or executables available in releases, the projects are required to be built by the user. This might be very challenging for regular users, who could lose interest in the project due to the process of building.</p>

## Future Practices: 

<p align="justify"><b>Automated workflows:</b> In order to maintain the integrity of the test cases, we plan to execute the workflows for testing and style-checkers on every git commit and preserve the results in GitHub actions.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Troubleshooting:</b> We plan to document possible troubleshooting solutions that could work in future. If dependencies or versions get deprecated, we will get it updated in a timely manner.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Direct Deployment:</b> We plan to include pre-built binaries or executable files in releases, so that users can directly download and execute the files to use the project without the need for dependencies or building the source code. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Proper Documentation:</b> We plan to make sure that our document is clear and precise which includes detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project, including dependencies, build instructions, and troubleshooting steps. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Timely Updation:</b> We will include a system which will notify us with updates of the dependencies which we used in the project so that we can update the requirements file or inform users to change versions. So that users will not face any errors while executing the code. </p>


<p align="justify"><b>Deployment in Git:</b> We are planning to host static webpages in GIT itself so it will be easy and also eye-catchy for users to use our website. Users will have a clear picture of how our website will be working even before running it.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Badge Generation:</b> We will make sure that the badge links are not broken and also make sure that the values are mapped correctly. </p>
