# INSIGHTS 

## Introduction: 
<p align="justify"> In the evolving landscape of technology and innovation, our team was assigned five projects that spanned various domains. The first project was "Slash", a web application meticulously crafted to scrape data from the most popular e-commerce websites, offering users a seamless experience in their quest for the best deals on a wide range of products. Our second project, "Cheap Buy," emerged as a sibling to Slash. While both projects revolve around finding the best deals for products, Cheap Buy takes a unique approach by accepting hyperlinks of products as input. The third project "Auto Anki", is a tool that bridges the gap between learning and memorization. Auto Anki is designed to transform comprehensive lectures into flashcards. Our fourth project “Stock Guide and Analyst” is focused on analyzing and predicting stocks. By leveraging complex algorithms and utilizing relevant data, they showcased a tool capable of forecasting stock market trends. Our fifth project centers around health and fitness. The "Calorie App" is a platform that not only helps users track their workouts but also offers a range of courses and resources related to fitness and well-being.  </p>
